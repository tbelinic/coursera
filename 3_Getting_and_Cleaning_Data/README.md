## Author: Tena Belinic

### run_analysis contains a set of the commands to achive the goal of the project.

## File containing a tidy data
tidy_data.txt

## Goal of the project was:
1. A tidy data set 
2. A link to a Github repository with a script for performing the analysis 
3. A code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. Also, there should be a README.md in the repo that explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.
